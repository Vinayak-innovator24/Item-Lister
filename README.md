# Item-Lister

This project is an item lister which adds new item to the items list and also has the option to remove them when not used. 

There are two search bars out of which top bar is used for searching items. Item whose name matches to the written text is only displayed on the item list and the rest items are hidden. 
Second search bar is not for searching items but for giving the name to a new item which has to be added and a new item to the text entered will be added with delete button. This bar also has the option that when any text is started to be written then it shows the previous written item names in case the user want to write similar names.
